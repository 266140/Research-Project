            <p class="lead mb-4">of writing a novel can, at times, come off as tedious, time-consuming, and trite. Mostly, you want to jump right into it, to make up your story as it goes; I've been there. But one thing you have to understand is no good book, novel, or movie (or any form of media for that matter) is finished on the spot, a good piece of work is one with time, care, and effort put into it, and all of that can be achieved by using the process this website is focused on. <br><br> As such, this website serves to break down the said process in an easy-to-digest way, and I will include an example story called <b>"RoughHouse"</b> that progressively gets developed with every step listed below so you can get a real feeling for what ensues in each step.</p> <br><br> <h2>Let's Go!</h2>

                  <h2 class="steps">Synopsis</h2>
                  <p>
                    In layman's terms, a <b>synopsis</b> is a story stripped down to its most basic form. It's not detailed and serves as an <b>outline</b> of your plot and characters. [1]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   For example, the synopsis for my story, <b>RoughHouse</b>, chornicles detective <b>Lenard Claymore</b> on his journey to defeat the 15 memebers of the <b>Surly Kingpin</b> gang before they can reach the city's sewer system, which they want to reach for reasons unknown to Lenard. 
                  </p>
                  <p> 
                    See what this synopsis does? It's simple! We've established the <b>protagonist</b> (Lenard), <b>antagonist</b> (Surly Kingpins), and the <b>plot</b> (Lenard must defeat the Surly Kingpins before the reach the sewer plant). You may notice that we've left some blank spaces open, but those are to be patched up in the next step!

                Now, through these six steps, we are left with a full story as a product of what we've learned! Of course, to type the whole story down would be quite a task, but I can give a summary that shows how much our story grew from its synopsis stage:

                     <b>Lenard Claymore</b>, a washed-up detctive who works for the <b>Hawkshaw Leauge</b> in NYC, is at risk of losing his job after he fails to catch a band of brothers who seemingly possesed phsychic powers. His boss, the elusive <b>Big Cheese</b>, gives him an opprotunity to get his job back by taking out all 15 of the mysterious member of the <b>Surly Kingpins</b>, who are trying to reach the <b>Manhatten sewer plant</b> for a reason he doesn't explain. Lenard and his colleuge, <b>Dr. Karl Nige</b>, go out together to take care of the 15 delinquents. Along the way, they enlist the help of <b>Truffles</b>, the gambiling-addicted ex-circus horse, and <b>Grandpa Buckly</b>, a parapalegic beaver who worked for a beaver mafia. As each Kingpin is taken down, Lenard becomes increasingly more suspicious of what the Big Cheese's motives are; but, it's only at the end he finds out things are not what they seem...

                This is what the summary of a complete story should like like: Nice and tidy, but filled with opprotunites for expansion! What made me able to make a whole website on this topic was a lot of reading, and a lot of writing. Gathering experience and using it in your own works. You could have up to a thousand stories and still keep going, there's a million ideas out there! You just have to stay commited and work on what you like. If you work with this mindset in place, I can assure that you are on the right path.
